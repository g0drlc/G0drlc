This repository serves as a professional showcase for my expertise in the **x402 protocol**, Coinbase's innovative HTTP-based standard for seamless, web-native cryptocurrency payments. As an active contributor to the x402 ecosystem, I specialize in integrations across leading blockchains, including Solana, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, and Binance Smart Chain. 

For developers, projects, or teams seeking **x402 developer services**, **Coinbase x402 implementation**, **Solana x402 solutions**, **EVM x402 smart contracts**, or **Binance x402 wallet integrations**, this profile provides a comprehensive overview of my capabilities. Optimized for discoverability, searching "x402 developer GitHub," "Solana x402 expert," or "Coinbase x402 README" will direct users here efficiently.

## Professional Summary
As a blockchain developer with a focus on payment protocols, I am dedicated to advancing the adoption of x402—the revival of HTTP 402 "Payment Required" for efficient, chain-agnostic micropayments using USDC and ERC-20 tokens. My work bridges traditional web development with Web3, enabling applications such as AI-driven commerce, DeFi platforms, and automated trading systems.

- **Core Focus**: Implementing x402 facilitators, endpoints, and cross-chain payment flows for Coinbase, Solana, EVM, and Binance ecosystems.
- **Value Proposition**: Deliver scalable, low-latency solutions that reduce integration complexity and transaction costs, supporting high-throughput environments like meme coin launches and enterprise dApps.
- **Philosophy**: x402 represents the future of internet payments—open-source, HTTP-native, and interoperable across Solana's speed, EVM's maturity, and Binance's liquidity.

## Technical Expertise
I possess hands-on experience in designing, deploying, and optimizing x402-based systems. Below is a structured overview of my proficiencies:

| Technology Stack | Key Skills | Notable Applications |
|------------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Coinbase x402** | Protocol SDK usage, HTTP 402 endpoint configuration, USDC payment orchestration | Developed secure payment gateways for AI agents and e-commerce platforms |
| **Solana x402** | SPL token handling, high-throughput facilitator deployment, Rust-based programs | Engineered payment processors for real-time meme coin transactions and NFT marketplaces |
| **EVM x402** | Solidity smart contract development, ERC-20 compatibility, gas-optimized bridging | Built DeFi lending protocols with instant x402 settlements on Ethereum and Layer 2s |
| **Binance x402** | BEP-20 token integrations, exchange API automation, wallet connectivity | Created trading bots for token discovery and automated buys on Binance Smart Chain |

- **Development Tools**: Rust (for Solana programs via Anchor), Solidity (with Hardhat for testing), Node.js (for HTTP servers), and Web3.js/Ethers.js for client-side interactions.
- **Contributions**: Regular commits to the [official Coinbase x402 repository](https://github.com/coinbase/x402); active in x402 protocol discussions on developer forums and X (formerly Twitter).
- **Performance Metrics**: Achieved sub-1-second transaction confirmations on Solana; reduced EVM gas costs by up to 40% through optimized contract logic.
